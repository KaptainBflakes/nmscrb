# nmscrb
"Name Scrub" Removes a given string from the filenames in a list of file paths.

Usage - Technical:  nmscrb [1] [2]

arg[1]: This is the string you want removed.

arg[2]: This is the list if filenames you want the string removed from.

Usage - General: Scrubs large numbers of filenames of their useless elements.

Note 1: Useful for removing useless and repetative data from filenames. Good for cleaning names in large media archives.

Note 2: If a file name in the list does not contain the string, the program won't crash nor will the batching break. Feel free to bash your lists with strings to scrub.
